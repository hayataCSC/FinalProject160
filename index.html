                My topic area is Economics. I am going to conduct an exploratory data analysis for my hypothesis about inflation.

            <p class="text">
                In the past decade, economies worldwide suffered from stubbornly low inflation rates despite tight labor markets. This combination of low inflation and low unemployment seems to violate one of the fundamental principles of economics: there is an inverse correlation between inflation and unemployment. To explain this phenomenon, I hypothesize that economic variables other than the inflation rate are putting downward pressure on prices. The variables to examine are the workers’ share of GDP and demographics (labor participation rates). The economies under consideration are America, Japan, and the European Union.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Using the D3 library, I’ll create a website to exhibit data in a way by which I can show the correlation between the two variables and inflation rates. Users of my website can switch countries to display and choose which variables to deliver on the graph.
